        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>One of the that I enjoyed and played during my chilhood and still love till this day is Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic the Hedgehog is a long running franchise, marking the official debut of Sega's then-new mascot: Sonic the Hedgehog, an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds and attack enemies with his signature Spin Attack maneuver.
            So I would like to touch on the a game that started the franchise and the newest one to the series.</p>
